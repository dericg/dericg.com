This is a fresh install of Wordpress 6.2.2

My intention is to initially develop [dericg.com](http://dericg.com/)
- I want to send mail from [dericg.com](http://dericg.com/)
- I want to create events calendar on [dericg.com](http://dericg.com/)

The site can send mail
Now we need to be able to enter a new user, ultimately to a specific group. The new user will then receive an email with their next steps.
- In this case, we want the user to be entered as a stakeholder, who will then receive a link to the stakeholder questionaare
- We'll use gravity forms to onboard the user,  but we will first refrain from adding them as a user in wordpress
-- We'll do this after the first is accomplished
